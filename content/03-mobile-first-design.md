## What is Mobile-First Design?

Mobile-first design is an approach to web design that involves starting the design process from the mobile perspective and then expanding the design to larger screens like tablets and desktops. This is in contrast to the traditional "graceful degradation" approach, where designers would start with a desktop site and then try to shrink it for mobile.

### Benefits for SEO and Performance

Google primarily uses the mobile version of a site for indexing and ranking (mobile-first indexing). Therefore, a well-optimised mobile site is critical for good search visibility. Mobile-first design also often leads to better performance, as it forces developers to focus on the most essential content and features first.
