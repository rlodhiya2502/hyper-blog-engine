## Why Performance Matters

Website speed is not just a technical metric; it's a fundamental part of the user experience. Slow websites lead to high bounce rates and poor conversion. Google has also confirmed that site speed is a ranking factor for both desktop and mobile searches.

### Implementing Lazy Loading

Lazy loading is a technique that defers the loading of non-critical resources (like images and videos) at page load time. Instead, these resources are loaded only when they are about to enter the viewport.

To enable lazy loading in this blog engine, all images **must** use a `data-src` attribute.

`<img data-src="https://placehold.co/800x400/2d3748/ffffff?text=Lazy+Loaded+Image" alt="An example image" class="lazy">`
